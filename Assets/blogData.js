      "Starting in May, I started working for a new startup called WorkPulse. The company was founded by serial-entrepreneur, Brody Saunders who previously founded companies such as IdealEstate and Wynbi. I have known Brody for a while and have always looked up to him. \n \n Our mission at WorkPulse is to solve one of the largest issues around working from home. Although there are many benefits to working from home such as choosing when and where you work. Additionally, employers have saved massive amounts of money while not paying for office space throughout the pandemic.  \n\n Sadly however, there have been some major drawbacks to working from home. First off, mental health has declined sharply because of people not interacting with each other as much. In a similar vein, workplace culture has declined. According to various sources, employee retention is down, along with effectiveness at work. We at WorkPulse believe that the cause of this is that workplace interactions are down. We are working on introducing a platform that increases the number of workplace interactions between coworkers when teams are working from home or people are out of the office for any reason. \n\n WorkPulse has the look and feel of many of the platforms that have preceded it. Join your team, or create groups dedicated just to sports, or to your favorite Netflix series. With sites such as Facebook which is too personal and LinkedIn which feels too robotic to create real connections, WorkPulse is aiming to be the one-stop-shop to connect with your coworkers on a more personal basis online.  \n \n I am thrilled to be working on WorkPulse. I think there is a lot of potential here. This is a real problem that I have encountered personally in my internships, and I am excited to help bring this solution to the world! üòÅ",
